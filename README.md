# Hey, I'm Manish 👋

**Building things. Breaking things. Learning things.**

I've been writing code for 13 years, but I'm more than just a keyboard warrior. Currently building **hyphn tech** and helping companies solve their challenging technical problems as an independent consultant. 

By day, I architect systems and lead teams. By night (and weekends), you'll find me playing guitar, reading Batman comics, or getting absolutely destroyed in badminton by my colleagues.

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

**Right Now:**
- **Founder @ HyphTech** - Building something from scratch (the fun part) and dealing with everything else (the character-building part)
- **Technical Consultant** - Companies bring me their "we're not sure how to solve this" problems, and I help them figure it out

**Previously:**
Led a team of 5+ engineers at Saavi Softwares, where we replaced messy long-running servers with elegant state machine workflows. Before that, spent years building full-stack applications, migrating monoliths to microservices, and learning the hard way that documentation is a love letter to your future self.

**The Real Story:**  
I started as a freelance kid building WordPress sites in 2012. Thirteen years later, I'm architecting distributed systems and running my own startup. The journey from "how do I center a div" to "how do I scale this to 10 million users" has been wild.

## 💻 Tech Stuff (Since You're Probably Here For That)

**I build with:**
- Multiple languages - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, PHP (and I'm not religious about any of them)
- Cloud platforms - AWS mostly, but I've worked with Azure and GCP too
- Distributed systems, microservices, event-driven architectures, and all those buzzwords that actually matter when you're at scale

**I think about:**
- Architecture patterns that survive contact with reality
- Team structures that don't make people want to quit
- Documentation that people actually read
- Tests that catch bugs before customers do
- The eternal debate: monolith or microservices? (Answer: it depends)

**I believe in:**
- Picking the right tool for the job, not the tool I know best
- Clean code that doesn't need a PhD to understand
- Shipping features > perfect architecture
- But also: good architecture > heroic debugging sessions

## 🎵 The Non-Code Part

**Music:** I play guitar (badly, but enthusiastically). Music theory fascinates me - there's something beautiful about how math and emotion intersect in a chord progression. Currently trying to figure out how Blackstratblues makes everything sound so smooth.

**Comics:** Started collecting recently - Batman, Swamp Thing, Constantine (DC universe has my heart). There's something about Alan Moore's writing that hits different. If you want to talk about Sandman or argue about the best Batman story arc, I'm your person.

**Sports:** Weekends are for getting my ass kicked in badminton, football, and cricket with colleagues. Turns out being good at algorithms doesn't translate to sports. Who knew?

## 📚 Things I'm Learning Right Now

- How to build a startup (turns out coding is the easy part)
- Advanced music theory (why do certain chord progressions make me cry?)
- How to actually catch a cricket ball (still working on this one)
- Product management (because founders wear all the hats)
- When to say no to clients (hardest skill in consulting)

## 💭 How I Think About Work

I've been in the game long enough to know:
- Perfect code doesn't exist, but good-enough code that ships does
- The best architecture is the one your team can actually maintain
- Sometimes you need microservices, sometimes you need a monolith, often you need sleep
- Good documentation is a superpower
- The fanciest tech stack won't save you from unclear requirements

**My philosophy:** Build things that work. Write code that doesn't make future-you want to time travel back and fight present-you. Treat your team like humans, not resources. And for the love of all that is holy, write tests.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm building HyphnTech, but I'm also open to the right opportunities:

- **Consulting projects** where I can dive deep into gnarly technical challenges
- **Technical advisory** for startups navigating their growth phase

Not interested in:
- Companies that think "rockstar developer" is a job title
- Places where "work-life balance" is code for "we don't have any"
- Roles where I can't actually make decisions

## 🗣️ Let's Talk

Building something interesting? Stuck on a technical problem? Want to debate whether Batman could beat Superman in a real fight? (He could, with prep time - or take over the whole multiverse, Dark Nights: Metal FTW).

**PS:** If you made it this far, you probably noticed I'm not your typical "senior software engineer with 5+ years experience in..." profile. Good. Those are boring. Life's too short for boring profiles.

**PPS:** Yes, I know Constantine is technically more Vertigo than DC proper. Don't @ me.
