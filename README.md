# Hey, I'm Manish 👋

**Building things. Breaking things. Learning things.**

I've been writing code for 13 years, but I'm more than just a keyboard warrior. Currently building **hyphn tech** and helping companies solve their challenging technical problems as an independent consultant. 

By day, I architect systems and lead teams. By night (and weekends), you'll find me playing guitar, reading Batman comics, or getting absolutely destroyed in badminton by my colleagues.

With 12 years of experience—from learning design patterns to architecting systems spanning monolithic, serverless, and distributed computing—I'm now building my own startup and consulting independently. These days, I focus on large-scale data pipelines and solving AI problems for companies.

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

**Right Now:**
- **Founder @ Hyphn** - Building distributed systems and data infrastructure
- **Technical Consultant** - Working with innovative companies on large-scale data pipelines and AI integration

**Previously:**
Led teams building production systems processing millions of records daily. Replaced manual batch scripts with distributed pipelines using NestJS, BullMQ, and the Producer-Worker pattern. Before that, spent years building full-stack applications, migrating monoliths to microservices, and learning that documentation is a love letter to your future self.

## 💻 Tech Stuff

**I build with:**
- Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust (learning), PHP
- Cloud: AWS (S3, CloudFront, Lambda), Azure, GCP
- Distributed systems: NestJS, BullMQ, Redis, Docker
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Game dev: Phaser 2 (for fun projects)

**I think about:**
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets
- Horizontal scaling patterns
- Fault tolerance and zero data loss
- Clean architecture that survives production
- The eternal debate: monolith or microservices? (Answer: it depends)

**I believe in:**
- Picking the right tool for the job, not the tool I know best
- Clean code that doesn't need a PhD to understand
- Shipping features > perfect architecture
- But also: good architecture > heroic debugging sessions

## 🎵 The Non-Code Part

**Music:** I play guitar and explore music theory. Currently figuring out how Blackstratblues makes everything sound so smooth.

**Comics & Stories:** Batman, Swamp Thing, Constantine (DC universe). Alan Moore's writing hits different. Always down to talk about Constantine or debate the best Batman story arc.

**Sports:** Weekends are for badminton, football, and cricket. Turns out being good at algorithms doesn't translate to catching a cricket ball.

## 📝 Digital Garden

I maintain a digital garden at [manishj.com/garden](https://manishj.com/garden) where I share:
- Building distributed pipelines to process 1 crore records daily
- Pre-LLM era game development with Phaser 2 and Stack Overflow
- Monte Carlo methods and distributed computing experiments
- Technical notes at various stages: seedling 🌱, budding 🌿, evergreen 🌳

## 🎯 Open To

- **Consulting projects** diving deep into data pipelines and distributed systems
- **Technical advisory** for startups scaling their infrastructure
- **Interesting conversations** about architecture, music theory, or whether Batman could beat Superman (he could, with prep time)

**PS:** If you made it this far, you probably noticed this isn't your typical "senior software engineer with 5+ years experience in..." profile. Good. Those are boring. Life's too short for boring profiles.
